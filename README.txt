Hello,

This software was written for a school project.
It aims to generate 3D pictures thanks to raytracing.

The code is written in Python 3.
If you want to generate a 3D image, please run one of the python files in scenes. You will also find the resulting picture with the same name, in the same folder.

Thank you for reading !
