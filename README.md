# Raytracing renderer

This renderer generates 3D pictures using raytracing methods.
It was written in the scope of a school project at CentraleSup√©lec.

## Getting started

To generate a 3D image, run one of the python files in `scenes` folder.
You will find the rendered scene in a picture file of the same name, in the same folder.
